# Hi, I’m Jishnu 👋  

📍 Ingolstadt ↔ Munich | ⚙️ C++ Systems Engineer  

I build **clean, deterministic C++ libraries** with a strong focus on **API design, correctness, and long-term maintainability**.  
My interests are modern C++ (17/20), data modeling, and systems that are easy to reason about under real constraints.

Formerly working on Automated driving; currently investing deeply in core language fundamentals, data structures, and design trade-offs.
