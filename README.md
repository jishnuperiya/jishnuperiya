# Hi, I’m Jishnu 👋  

📍 Ingolstadt ↔ Munich | ⚙️ C++ Systems Engineer  

I build **clean, deterministic C++ libraries** with a strong focus on **API design, correctness, and long-term maintainability**.  
My interests are modern C++ (17/20), data modeling, and systems that are easy to reason about under real constraints.

Formerly working on production C++ systems; currently investing deeply in core language fundamentals, data structures, and design trade-offs.

## Current Project

### 🧩 Harmony-lib  
*A modern C++ library focused on expressive, safe, and composable data transformations.*

Harmony-lib explores how to design **small, powerful abstractions** that:

- Enforce strong invariants through types  
- Prefer immutability and value semantics  
- Are deterministic and easy to test  
- Scale from simple use cases to complex pipelines  
- Remain readable and maintainable over time

The project is intentionally domain-agnostic and serves as a **laboratory for professional-grade C++ library design**.

> The goal is not features — it’s *clarity, correctness, and trust*.

## Work History

### Software Engineer (C++ / Systems)
**TechHub by e:fs (Audi / CARIAD ecosystem)**  
*2021 – 2025*

- Developed and maintained production-grade **C++ systems** for ADAS / autonomous driving
- Worked on **sensor pipelines** (LiDAR, camera), data replay, and evaluation tooling
- Built deterministic components with strict timing, correctness, and performance constraints
- Collaborated in large, safety-conscious codebases with long-lived architectures

## What I’m Doing Right Now

- 📚 Strengthening **data structures & algorithms** in C++  
- 🧠 Revisiting **systems fundamentals** (memory, lifetimes, performance)  
- 🛠️ Iterating on Harmony-lib with an emphasis on **API quality**  
- 🎯 Preparing for roles where **deep C++ understanding matters**
